### Introduction

This is a simple application that demonstrates how we can connect nextjs front end with Grafbase which is a serverless backend for GraphQL. The entire project 
is explained in my blog post [here](https://www.webwinx.com/2023/01/30/go-serverless-for-graphql-backend-with-grafbase/).

### Frontend Usage

```bash
cd next
yarn dev
```

### Backend Usage

```bash
cd grafbase
npx grafbase dev
```
